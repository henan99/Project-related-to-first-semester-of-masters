Motivated by the search for the source of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and high energy neutrinos, one has in this report discussed the evolution of different classes of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), a potential candidate for high energy particles, and calculated their emissivity of UHECRs and neutrinos based on the X-ray luminosity. This emissivity was then compared to the emissivity of UHECRs and neutrinos as seen by ground based telescopes here on Earth. 
In addition, one has also discussed the population evolution and population distribution over luminosity of the different classes. These classes are, Blazars, Seyfert galaxies, radio galaxies, Flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), BL Lacertae (Bl lac), and all Compton thin AGN. 
To do this one considered the luminosity functions of different classes generated by surveys looking in the X-ray band.
The results of the luminosity functions shows that the distribution of AGN over luminosity is different for two larger classes of AGN, jet-dominated and non-jet-dominated. Most jet-dominated AGN show a preferred luminosity around which we find the most AGN, while most non-jet-dominated AGN show an increase in numbers towards lower luminosity and a break luminosity where their slope index change. For the redshift evolution one 
also find a difference between the two classes. The total population for most jet-dominated AGN show a peak at earlier redshift than non-jet-dominated AGN. Both results have an interesting exception which are the Bl lacs who are increasing in numbers with lower redshift and also show an increase in numbers towards lower luminosities but belong to the class of jet-dominated AGN. 
The second part of the analysis in this report focuses on the emissivity UHECRs and neutrinos. One shows that assuming a similar luminosity between X-ray, UHECRs, and neutrinos, almost all classes of AGN can alone produce the observed diffuse flux of UHECRs and neutrinos. One concludes that one needs a better correlation model 
between X-ray and the particles to make a more accurate estimate of the emissivity of UHECRs and neutrinos. In addition, one wants a model that includes the observational properties of AGN, most notably jet orientation.
